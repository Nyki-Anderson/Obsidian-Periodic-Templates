# üóìÔ∏è Obsidian-Periodic-Templates
This is a collection of my templates for periodic journal templates including: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly notes.

## üéØ Objectives
I have spent a long time working out how exactly I want my periodic journal to operate. I have taken it as a personal challenge to configure my journal content so that it is adaptable to each day, measurable for long term goal and progress review, and automatable for obvious reasons. This repository will keep the various versions of templates I have derived personally and through extensive crowd-sourcing of others' methodologies. I will provide links to any inspiration that I used to develop my templates as well. 

## üì¶ Contents
This projecf is a work in progress so revisit often for updates and improvements. I will do my best to maintain this repsository as its contents are altered in my personal vault. I wanted to start journaling by the January 1st 2024 (though I didn't officially start until the 2nd) though I did not have as much time as I thought I would between Fall and Soring semester to do so. The *planned* contents of this Obsidian periodic templates repository are as follows:

- Daily Notes Template(s)
- Weekly Summary Template(s)
- Monthly Overview Template(s)
- Quarterly Goals Template(s)
- Yearly Progress Template(s)

### Daily Notes Template(s)
These notes are intended to capture the raw data of the day: tasks, events, musings, and personal objectives. I am playing around with adaptive formatting so that each day can unfold naturally throughout the note rather than have a list of designated prompts that must be filled, as this has not worked for me in the past. The scope of the daily note is anything and everything that has value at the moment and I am designing the structure to be able to handle the broadest scope while being streamlined and fun/playful at the same time. Each expansion in scope should be able to either quantify or query the various entries in the daily note in a meaningful way. Anything that does not satisfy this goal will be continually reworked until it does. 

### Weekly Summmary Template(s)
The goal of the weekly note is to gather and summarize the musings of the week at a glance but with easy integration back to the raw undistilled body of information when desired. Basically I want to be able to see everything visually or graphically upfront but be able to drill back into the original entry and even expand on them without leaving the weekly interface. I also want to track habits and progress toward more long-term projects and such but this may be better realized in later iterations. The weekly note should zoom me outward just enough to see the forest throuugh the daily trees. 

### Monthly Overview Template(s)

### Quarterly Goals Template(s)

### Yearly Progress Template(s)

# üß∞ Tools & Configuration
I will update this readme to include all the Obsidian plugins I make use of and provide screenshots where helpful to describe configuration of these tools. I also make heavy use of Javascript (which I am learning as I go) so excuse any errant logic if anything seems too labored or roundabout, please. 

## üçé Feedback & Questions Welcome!
I love sharing what I learn so don't hesitate but I am no expert... Please provide feedback or ask questions for clarification and expect me to be responsive. I also would love to hear ways to improve what I've done -- criticisms are taken constructively! 

# üíô Thank You
