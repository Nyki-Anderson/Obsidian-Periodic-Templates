# 🗓️ Obsidian-Periodic-Templates
This is a collection of my templates for periodic journal templates including: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly notes. 

# :sparkles: Features:
These templates:
- Use **Javascript**, **Dataview** queries, and **Templater** to provide a seamless and automated journaling experience that is directly integrated with both the **Calendar** and **Periodic Notes** plugins. 
- Contain a navigational menu to jump between periodic scopes.
- Dynamically create new periodic notes (at any scope-level) via the navigational links and use the corresponding template.
- Automatically move each note to the desired folder/subfolder and have unique names at the note-level so linking is simplified.
- Contain all necessary metadata to capture and later query entries in customizably meaningful ways.

> 🎯 **Objectives**
> 
> I have spent a long time working out how exactly I want my periodic journal to operate. I have taken it as a personal challenge to configure my journal content so that it is adaptable to each day, measurable for long term goal and progress review, and automatable for obvious reasons. 
> 
> This repository will keep the various versions of templates I have derived personally and through extensive crowd-sourcing of others' methodologies. I will provide links to any inspiration that I used to develop my templates as well.

> ❗ **Tip**:
> 
> To get the most out of this repository, follow this `README.md` file like a tutorial. The configuration of this system spans several plugins and is nuanced at times... To customize it to your own naming conventions and such will require you understand how the whole system works together. 
>
> A [TL;DR](#📚-tldr) can be found at the bottom of this `README.md` for those who wish to understand how the system was put together but not necessarily the implementation I describe in detail.

# 🗺️ Walkthrough
This walkthrough will go through the entire setup as is used in my personal vault. The directory structure of this vault is **NOT** reflected in the directory structure of this repository. 

## :toolbox: Community Plugins
I will include any Obsidian plugins I make use of and provide screenshots where helpful to describe configuration of these tools. 

> :notebook: Note: I make heavy use of Javascript (which I am learning as I go) so excuse any errant logic if anything seems too labored or roundabout, please.

### Tasks

### *Optional*
- Linter: In order to maintain definite style and formatting conventions throughout my vault, I use the plugin **Linter**. I lint on save in the rest of my vault but this would be destructive if my templates and other utilities were altered each time I instinctively press `Command-S`. So in the Linter options, I add the entire `The Utilities` folder to the `Folders to Ignore` list. 

## :building_construction: Vault Setup

My personal vault is organized mainly into folderized **Scopes**. The two main-level folders that pertain to this project are `The Journal` and `The Utilities` folders.

## 💻 Implementation

### 🗒️ Daily Notes Template(s)
These notes are intended to capture the raw data of the day: tasks, events, musings, and personal objectives. I am playing around with adaptive formatting so that each day can unfold naturally throughout the note rather than have a list of designated prompts that must be filled, as this has not worked for me in the past. The scope of the daily note is anything and everything that has value at the moment and I am designing the structure to be able to handle the broadest scope while being streamlined and fun/playful at the same time. Each expansion in scope should be able to either quantify or query the various entries in the daily note in a meaningful way. Anything that does not satisfy this goal will be continually reworked until it does. 

### 🌎 Weekly Summmary Template(s)
The goal of the weekly note is to gather and summarize the musings of the week at a glance but with easy integration back to the raw undistilled body of information when desired. Basically I want to be able to see everything visually or graphically upfront but be able to drill back into the original entry and even expand on them without leaving the weekly interface. I also want to track habits and progress toward more long-term projects and such but this may be better realized in later iterations. The weekly note should zoom me outward just enough to see the forest throuugh the daily trees.
